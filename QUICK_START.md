## ⚠️ If You Get Errors

See the TROUBLESHOOTING.md file for help!

Most common issue: You're in the wrong folder. Make sure you're inside `vision-final`.

Check with:
```bash
# See current folder
pwd

# Should show path ending in: vision-final
```

If not, navigate to it:
```bash
cd Downloads/vision-final
```
(Change the path based on where you extracted it)
